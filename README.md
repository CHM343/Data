## Description of Data Files
R134a_Vapor_Pressure_Exp_Data.txt - CSV (comma deliminated) ascii file with the first line being the data column heading and associated units. This data was from 'A constant volume apparatus for vapour pressure and gas phase P-v-T measurements: validation with data from R22 and R134a', Fluid Phase Equilibria, 1995, 109, 265-279.  The data is a subset of Table 1, experimental vapour pressure data for R22 and R134a.

Saturated_Vapor_Pressure_Data.txt - CSV (comma deliminated) ascii file with the first line being the data column heading and associated units. The source of the data is from Tables A8 - A10, M.J. Moran and H.N. Shapiro, Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics, 2nd Ed., 1992, and originally based on equations from D.P. Wilson et al, Thermodynamic Properties of the New Stratospherically Safe Working Fluid-Refrigerant - R134a, ASHRAE Trans., 94, 2095-2118 (1988).

Temp_Rate_Constant_kerr_Example_Data_CHM343.txt - CSV (comma deliminated) ascii file with the first line being the data column heading and associated units. This data was derived from 'An open-source, cross-platform resource for nonlinear least-squared curve fitting', Journal of Chemical Education, 2018, 95, 2273-2278 (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jchemed.8b00649).  The data was showing in figure 2A and 2C, and discussed in the section, 'Use Case 1: Temperature Dependence of Reaction Rate Constants According to the Arrhenius Equation'.
